I can't resent the fact that his friends are his. To insert myself into the spaces that I am now missing is selfish. I always knew I was a guest friend to these people, despite all of the time I spent with them. When I broke up with him, I knew that a consequence would be the loss of these spaces. I knew that alienation from these friends was unavoidable.

What did I do wrong? I feel like every corner I am turning someone tells me that I did something wrong yet I cannot for the life of me figure it out. There is something wrong with me that I do not know. There are inadequacies that point and stick out of my like awkward sores and bumps.

Last year, I was at my happiest when I was with him and his friends, and my saddest when I knew that it all had to end. Hanging out with them made me feel the most at home I have ever felt during college, but this feeling was always transient when I remembered that it was terrible of me to let this continue with him. 

I know I went about telling him about L* wrongly. I procrastinated breaking the news too long, but in that moment made the right choice when I prioritized showing my affection for L* over the burdens I carry from the past. Maybe procrastination is at the root of my problems---academic, social, & in relationships. 

An emotionally mature person would do the following. (1) Talk to L* about what I am feeling, (2) Give N* his space to process, and (3) talk to N* after time has passed and express to him the things that I have felt.
