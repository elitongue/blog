## Letter

Dear NA,

I am sorry for being the person I was during our relationship, and for how I handled dating someone new. I wanted to treat you as best as I could during the breakup process, and failed in a way that I am not proud of.

I am a fearful, insecure, and anxious person. Because of the way I was raised, I am embarrassed to feel the things I feel and act in the ways I would like to. This became a problem during our relationship, and I am really sorry for that. The ways that these problems were realized---e.g. my fear of PDA and saying 'I love you'---did not reflect anything about the way I felt about you during our relationship. These were my problems to fix, and I am sorry that I did not fix them while we were dating.

I try not to be this way, and I believe that I am much better now than before. The hard truth is that change was necessary for me to grow as a person. I felt dependent, emotionally underdeveloped, and immature in our relationship. I spent all my time with you and your suitemates, never confronted my shortcomings in how I expressed myself, and had a very shaky sense of self-worth. During spring break, Sarah and I talked a lot about emotions, relationships, and becoming well-adjusted. When we broke up, I wanted to confront my problems and learn to be a better person to myself and others.

It was hard, and I failed. When I ate meals by myself and spent nights alone, I felt friendless, depressed, and worthless. I coped with isolation and started seeing Lolyn in mid-April. It unexpectedly became something more, and although disappointed in myself for failing to grow up, I have been generally happy.

I am sorry for putting Sarah in the middle of this. I have told her how sorry I am to her for making her keep a secret from you. It was selfish of me and I regret it immensely.
